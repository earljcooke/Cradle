![Cradle Logo](./src/main/resources/static/images/readme/Cradle-4-logo.png)

### OVERVIEW
---
*"The Microlife CRADLE VSA [is a device to] accurately measure blood pressure
and heart rate and uses these values to calculate whether the women is at risk
of developing shock."* (Credit: 
[CRADLE Trial](http://cradletrial.com/the-device/))

VHT (Village Health Team) Workers use the device to read their patients and,
based on the patient's status (denoted by a "red, yellow, green light" system),
VHTs will then make a referral to the appropriate medical facility.

The purpose of this application is to serve as a companion Android app for VHTs
to record their readings on the field into a central database, as well as a
web app for medical workers in proper medical facilities to quickly access the
data that VHTs send, and a database to store the information VHTs enter, as
well as any follow-up information the medical workers enter; this repository
holds the web app as well as the database.

### FEATURES
---
#### Referral Tool:
- Sync readings from VHTs in real-time for health facility workers to access
- Allow health workers to enter readings, diagnoses or treatements and the
  follow-up required by the VHTi
- Show most appropriate management for patient from decision algorithm, based
  on patient status (age, pregnancy status, ethnicity, suspected diagnosis,
  etc.)
#### Individual Patient Monitoring:
- Store multiple readings for individual patients; allow viewing the data
  trends over time via graphs
- Record medications, as well as date started, date discontinued (if
  applicable), dosage, and side effects
- Alert health workers if readings are abnormal
#### VHT Monthly Reports:
- For any referral, VHTs and health workers will be able to view the health
  centre referred to, the distance to the health facility, and the method of
  transportation
#### Educational Tools:
- Videos with advice for health care workers
